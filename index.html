            You leapt from crumbling bridges
            Watching cityscapes turn to dust

            Filming helicopters crashing
            In the ocean from way above

            Got the music in you, baby
            Tell me why
            Got the music in you, baby
            Tell me why
            You've been locked in here forever
            And you just can't say goodbye

            Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
            Wrapped in your arms

            You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
            Left in the dark

            Got the music in you, baby
            Tell me why
            Got the music in you, baby
            Tell me why
            You've been locked in here forever
            And you just can't say goodbye

            Your lips, my lips
            Apocalypse

            Your lips, my lips
            Apocalypse

            Go and sneak us through the rivers
            Flood is rising up on your knees
            Oh, please
            Come out and haunt me
            I know you want me
            Come out and haunt me

            Sharing all your secrets with each other
            Since you were kids

            Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
            Clutched in your fist

            Got the music in you, baby
            Tell me why
            Got the music in you, baby
            Tell me why
            You've been locked in here forever
            And you just can't say goodbye
            You've been locked in here forever
            And you just can't say goodbye

            Ooh, oh
            When you're all alone
            I'll reach for you
            When you're feelin' low
            I'll be there too
